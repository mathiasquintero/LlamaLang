# LlamaLang
Repository for the Llama Programming Language.
This is a Programming Language I'm defining since I wanted to try out Python and always wanted to make one. ;)

So far it's really simple:

Define a variable:

```
let var = "My Variable"
```

Define a function

```
let square = x -> x * x
```
